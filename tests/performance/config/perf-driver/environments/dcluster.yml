# Configuration Fragment : Local Marathon Environment         #
# ----------------------------------------------------------- #
# This fragment instructs the driver to launch marathon with  #
# it's own mesos simulator (locally). This fragment assumes   #
# that the driver runs in a development environment with      #
# scala properly configured.                                  #
