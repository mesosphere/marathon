# Project Status

Support for DC/OS ends on October 31, 2021. We will continue to provide support for our current DC/OS customers per their contracts, of course. However, we will no longer be investing in new features or capabilities or maintaining the related repositories. If a customer wishes to continue use of the DC/OS Enterprise platform or other non-free DC/OS components, the customer can purchase an End-of-Life License or Perpetual Use License, however support is not included in these licenses and continued use of DC/OS will be at your own discretion and risk. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.

We want to thank all of our loyal customers, particularly those DC/OS users who were fellow pioneers in the growth of the cloud native landscape from the beginning.

# [Marathon](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/) [![Build Status](https://jenkins.mesosphere.com/service/jenkins/buildStatus/icon?job=marathon-pipelines/master)](https://jenkins.mesosphere.com/service/jenkins/buildStatus/icon?job=marathon-pipelines/master) [![Issues](https://img.shields.io/badge/Issues-JIRA-ff69b4.svg?style=flat)](https://jira.mesosphere.com/projects/MARATHON/issues/)

Marathon is a production-proven [Apache Mesos][Mesos] framework for container orchestration. [DC/OS](https://dcos.io/get-started/#marathon) is the easiest way to start using Marathon. Issues are tracked in [JIRA](https://jira.mesosphere.com/projects/MARATHON/issues/).

Marathon provides a
[REST API](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/docs/rest-api.html) for
starting, stopping, and scaling applications. Marathon is written in Scala and
can run in highly-available mode by running multiple copies. The
state of running tasks gets stored in the Mesos state abstraction.

Marathon is also used as a *meta framework*: you can start other Mesos frameworks such as
Chronos or [Storm][Storm] with it to ensure they survive machine failures.
It can launch anything that can be launched in a standard shell. In fact, you
can even start other Marathon instances via Marathon.

## Features

* *HA* - run any number of Marathon schedulers, but only one gets elected as
    leader; if you access a non-leader, your request gets proxied to the
    current leader
* *[Constraints](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/docs/constraints.html)* - e.g., only one instance of an application per rack, node, etc.
* *[Service Discovery &amp; Load Balancing](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/docs/service-discovery-load-balancing.html)* via HAProxy or the events API (see below).
* *[Health Checks](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/docs/health-checks.html)*: check your application's health via HTTP or TCP checks.
* *[Event Subscription](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/docs/rest-api.html#event-subscriptions)* lets you supply an HTTP endpoint to receive notifications, for example to integrate with an external load balancer.
* *[Marathon UI](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/docs/marathon-ui.html)*
* *[JSON/REST API](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/docs/rest-api.html)* for easy integration and scriptability
* *[*Basic Auth* and *SSL*](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/docs/ssl-basic-access-authentication.html)*
* *[Metrics](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/docs/metrics.html)*:
  query them at `/metrics` in JSON format, push them to systems like Graphite, StatsD and DataDog, or scrape them using Prometheus.

## Setting Up And Running Marathon

### Dependencies
Marathon has the following compile-time dependencies:
* sbt - A build tool for scala. You can find the instructions for installing sbt for Mac OS X and Linux over [here](http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/tutorial/Setup.html).
* JDK 1.8+

For run-time, Marathon has the following dependencies:
* libmesos - JNI bindings for talking to Apache Mesos master. Look at the *Install Mesos* section for instructions to get libmesos.
* Apache Zookeeper - You can have a separate Zookeeper installation specifically for Marathon, or you can use the same Zookeeper used by Mesos.

### Installation

#### Getting started with [DC/OS](https://dcos.io/get-started/#marathon)
The by far easiest way to get Marathon running is to use [DC/OS](https://dcos.io/get-started/#marathon). Marathon is pre-bundled into [DC/OS](https://dcos.io/get-started/#marathon).

#### Install Mesos
Marathon requires libmesos, a shared object library, that contains JNI bindings for Marathon to talk to the Mesos master. *libmesos* comes as part of the Apache Mesos installation. There are three options for installing Apache Mesos.

##### Installing Mesos from prepackaged releases
Instructions on how to install prepackaged releases of Mesos are available [in the Marathon docs](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/docs/).

##### Building Mesos from source
**NOTE:** *Choose this option only if building Marathon from source, else there might be version incompatibility between pre-packaged releases of Marathon and Mesos built from source.*

You can find the instructions for compiling Mesos from source in the [Apache Mesos getting started docs](http://mesos.apache.org/getting-started/). If you want Mesos to install libraries and executables in a non-default location use the --prefix option during configuration as follows:

```console
./configure --prefix=<path to Mesos installation>
```

The `make install` will install libmesos (libmesos.so on Linux and libmesos.dylib on Mac OS X) in the install directory.

##### Using the Mesos Version Manager
**NOTE:** *Choose this option only if building Marathon from source, else there might be version incompatibility between pre-packaged releases of Marathon and Mesos built from source.*  

The Mesos Version Manager (mvm) compiles, configures, and manages multiple versions of Apache Mesos.
It allows switching between versions quickly, making it easy to test Marathon against different versions of Mesos.

###### Prerequisites

The Mesos Version Manager assumes that all dependencies of Apache Mesos are readily installed.  
Please refer to the [Apache Mesos getting started docs](http://mesos.apache.org/gettingstarted/) for instructions on how to set up the build environment.

MVM compiles Mesos with SSL support by default, which requires openssl and libevent to be installed.  
On macOS, the packages can be installed using brew: `brew install openssl libevent`  
On CentOS, the packages can be installed using yum: `sudo yum install -y libevent-devel openssl-devel`

###### Usage

The script can be run as follows:

        cd marathon
        cd tools
        ./mvm.sh <VERSION> [SHELL]

The following command will launch a bash shell configured for Mesos 1.2.0: `./mvm.sh 1.2.0 bash`

You should consider placing the script into a folder in your shell's `PATH` if you are using it regularly.

The mvm script accepts three different formats as version name:

1. Version tags from the Mesos repository. Use `./mvm.sh --tags` in order to obtain a list of available tags.
2. Commit hashes from the Mesos repository.
3. The `--latest` flag, which automatically chooses the latest development version: `./mvm.sh --latest`.

MVM Will automatically download & compile Apache Mesos if necessary.
It will then spawn a new bash shell with the chosen version of Mesos activated.  
For more information see `./mvm.sh --help`.

**Note**: You will have to re-run the script if you wish to use Mesos after closing the shell.
See `./mvm.sh --help` information on how to  permanently configure your shell for mvm to avoid this.

#### Install Marathon

Instructions on how to install prepackaged releases are available [in the Marathon docs](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/docs/). Alternatively, you can build Marathon from source.

##### Building from Source

1.  To build Marathon from source, check out this repo and use sbt to build a universal:

        git clone https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon.git
        cd marathon
        sbt 'run --master localhost:5050 --zk zk://localhost:2181/marathon'
    
    **Troubleshooting**
    1. Failure in retrieval of IP address of the local machine will result in an error and may look like this:
    
        `Failed to obtain the IP address for '<local-machine>'; the DNS service may not be able to resolve it: nodename nor servname provided, or not known`
        
        Make sure that `LIBPROCESS_IP` environment variable is set.
        ```
        export LIBPROCESS_IP="127.0.0.1"
        ```
    1. When the `MESOS_NATIVE_JAVA_LIBRARY` environment variable is not set, the following error may occur,
        
        `java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no mesos in java.library.path...`
        
        Make sure that `MESOS_NATIVE_JAVA_LIBRARY` environment variable is set.
        ```
        export MESOS_NATIVE_JAVA_LIBRARY="/path/to/mesos/lib/libmesos.dylib"
        ```

##### Packaging Marathon

1.  Run `sbt universal:packageZipTarball` to package Marathon as an txz file
    containing bin/marathon fully packaged. This is the packaging method used for Marathon in DC/OS. For DC/OS EE, additional plugins are required.

1. Run `cd tools/packager; make tag-docker` for a local Marathon docker image. You can push this image to a Docker image repository and deploy it as a MoM (Marathon on Marathon). This image of Marathon will not contain any DC/OS EE specific plugins.

### Running in Development Mode

Mesos local mode allows you to run Marathon without launching a full Mesos
cluster. It is meant for experimentation and not recommended for production
use. Note that you still need to run ZooKeeper for storing state. The following
command launches Marathon on Mesos in *local mode*. Point your web browser to
`http://localhost:8080` to see the Marathon UI.

        mesos-local
        sbt 'run --master localhost:5050 --zk zk://localhost:2181/marathon'

For more information on how to run Marathon in production and configuration
options, see [the Marathon docs](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/docs/).
